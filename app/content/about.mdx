I started my coding journey back in 2011 when I was in high school. I took a
class where we learned C++, and the next semester I learned Java. That was the first
time I remember feeling a love for creating things with code.

Later, I went to college at BYU in Utah where I majored in math. I thought about doing
computer engineering for a minute, but ended up doing math instead. I still loved coding,
though, and I minored in computer science.

The reason I majored in math is because I wanted to be a data scientist.
I was really into statistics and machine learning. I worked for a couple different math
professors doing math and maching learning research while in school, and I really enjoyed
that.

There came a point, though, where I realized I wanted to do software development.
So that's what I did.
